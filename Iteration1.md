# Semester Project: Money Management System  
## Iteration 1 – User Stories and Use Case Diagram  

### System Description  
For this project, you will design the foundation of a **Money Management System**. This system allows users to record and track their personal finances over time. Users can enter details such as income, expenses, budgets, debts, and funds. The system provides a way to organize these entries and monitor financial health, including how money is earned, spent, and allocated.  

Your goal is not to build the system yet, but to understand its scope through **user stories** and a **use case diagram**. These artifacts will capture what the system should do, who will use it, and how it will be used.  

### Deliverables  
You are responsible for producing the following:  

1. **User Stories**  
   - Write user stories that capture the needs and goals of different users.  
   - Each story must follow a clear format, such as:  
     - *As a \<user\>, I want \<feature\> so that \<benefit\>.*  
     - *As a \<user\>, I need \<feature\> because \<reason\>.*  
   - Stories should demonstrate a robust system by covering a variety of users and features.
   - Stories must be written with a professional tone and clear wording (pretend you will be presenting this to a client).  

2. **Use Case Diagram**  
   - Create a use case diagram that includes **all user stories** you have written.  
   - Each use case should use the story’s title as its label.  
   - The diagram must be proper, clean, and professional, following standard notation.  
   - Focus on correct representation of users (actors), use cases, and their relationships.  

### Grading Criteria  
Your work will be evaluated based on the following loose criteria:  

- **System Robustness**: Does your collection of stories and diagram demonstrate coverage of a realistic, well-rounded system?  
- **Formatting & Tone**: Are the user stories written in the correct format and professional style?  
- **Diagram Quality**: Is the use case diagram properly constructed, clearly labeled, and professional in appearance?  
- **Completeness**: Do the deliverables together give a clear understanding of the system and its functionality?  

### Submission  
Submit both your user stories and use case diagram by adding them to the directory you cloned from Git. Then follow the commands below to push them to the remote repository.
```
git add "user story file" "use case diagram file"
git commit -m "Solution for Iteration 1"
git push -u origin main
```
>Note: the `-u origin main` sets the default location when you push work. In this case, it means you are setting it to the main branch of the remote repo your project is linked to (GitHub).
